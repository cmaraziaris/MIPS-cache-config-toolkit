# MIPS-cache-config-toolkit

## About

Set of MIPS assembly programs to help us find a secret cache configuration (*cache size*, *block size* and *associativity*) in both Data and Program cache. The expected cache size is `8KB`, `16KB` or `32KB`, the block size range is from 4 up to 64 words per block and the associativity degree range is from 1 up to 8.

We used the [QtMips simulator](https://github.com/cvut/QtMips) to simulate the cache.
 
More details of the implemention can be found in **[README.pdf](https://github.com/cmaraziaris/MIPS-cache-config-toolkit/blob/master/README.pdf)** (greek-only currently).
