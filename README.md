# MIPS-cache-config-toolkit
Set of MIPS assembly programs to help us find a secret cache configuration (cache size, block size and associativity).

We used the [QtMips simulator](https://github.com/cvut/QtMips) to simulate the Cache.
 
More details of the implemention can be found in README.pdf (in greek - for now).
